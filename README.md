Task1
CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.
USED PYTHON IN THIS

Task2
TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

Task3
IMAGE CAPTIONING

Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build
an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.

WITH UNDERSTANDING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE 2 TASKS I COULD GAIN IMPETUS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE WORKING AS IT MADE ME TO LEARN NEW STUFF AND CHARGE UP MY MEMORY.AS I AM A BEGINNER I HAD TO TAKE A LOT OF REFERENCES FROM YOUTUBE AND GITHUB SEE THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND THEN MAKE UP MY OWN CODE.BUT CODSOFT HELPED ME TO PUSH MY LIMITS AND THEREBY GIVE IN TRY TO EXPLORE NEW STUFF.I AM GRATEFUL TO CODSOFT THO HELP ME ACHIEVE A NEW STANDARD.
