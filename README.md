Task1
CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.
USED PYTHON IN THIS

Task2
TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

Task3
IMAGE CAPTIONING

Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build
an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.
